### Ingredients
- 140g parmesan cheese, finely grated
- 450g short pasta (i.e. "De Cecco Conchiglie Rigate")
- 125g unsalted butter, cold
- 2tbsp ground black pepper
- 1 cup milk
- 1 sprig thyme
- Salt for pasta cooking


### Instructions
Boil enough water to cook the pasta, add enough salt until the water is "ocean water" salty.

Add the pasta to the water and cook to instructions.

At the same time add 25g butter and the black pepper into a saucepan. Fry the pepper on medium heat until fragrant, around 1-2 minutes.

Add the milk and the thyme (the entire sprig) and bring to a low simmer. Turn the heat to low and whisk the butter into the milk, add half tbsp at a time and wait until fully melted to add the next piece of butter. Then remove the thyme sprig, take out the heat and wait for the pasta to be done.

Once both the sauce and pasta are done, reserve 1 cup of pasta water. Add half the pasta to the sauce, mix to coat the pasta with the sauce and add 1⁄3 of the parmesan. Mix until melted, then add the remaining pasta and another 3rd of the parmesan. Add extra pasta water if too thick. Once mixed add the remaining parmesan and mix until the sauce is creamy and glossy, it should not be too thick or too thin.

Serve into four bowls.
