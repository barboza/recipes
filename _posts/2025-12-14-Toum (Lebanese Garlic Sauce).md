Makes: 500ml 
Prep time: 10 min
Cook time: 10 min

Special utensils:
- Food processor
### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup garlic cloves peeled
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/5 cups neutral oil
- Juice of one lemon (about 1/4 cup)


### Instructions
Slice the garlic cloves in half lengthwise and remove any green sprouts.

Transfer the sliced garlic cloves into a food processor and add the salt to the garlic cloves. Process for around a minute until the garlic becomes finely minced almost paste looking. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the food processor.

While the food processor is running, if the food processor has an opening while running, slowly pour one to two tablespoons of oil, then stop and scrape down the bowl. Continue adding another tablespoon or two until the garlic starts looking creamy. If not possible to drizzle slowly, add a couple of table spoons at a time and mix until emulsified.

Once the garlic looks emulsified by the few tablespoons of oil, increase the speed of pouring the oil and alternate with the lemon juice until all the oil and lemon juice is incorporated. This will take about 15 minutes to complete. If too much oil or lemon juice are added the emulsion may break.

Transfer the sauce into a glass container and cover with a paper towel, leave in the fridge overnight. Makes about 500ml. The garlic flavor will mellow over time.

The next day, replace the paper towel with an airtight lid and keep in the fridge for up to 2-3 months. Don't forget to write down the date.
