## All-Purpose Enriched Bread
Makes 2 loaves
### Ingredients
-  240 grams (1 cup) whole milk or buttermilk
- 50 grams (6tbsp) plus 490 grams (3¾ cups) 550 flour, plus more, if needed, for work surface
- 5 large eggs, chilled
- 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
- 50 grams (¼ cup) granulated sugar
- 10 grams kosher salt
- 6 grams (2 tsp) active dry yeast
- 113 grams (½ cup) unsalted butter, cut into 1cm pieces, chilled, plus more, at room temperature, for pans

### Instructions

#### Tangzhong
In a saucepan, mix the milk and 50g (6 tbsp) flour. Bring over medium heat, whisk continuously, until tickened to a mashed potato consistency.
Add to a mixer bowl and let cool to room temperature (1h).

#### Dough
On the bowl with the room temperature tangzhong add 4 eggs, the oil, sugar, salt, yeast and remaining flour. Mix using the hook attachment on low until combined (~3 minutes). Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix on medium low until smooth, firm and elastic, scraping the sides 2 to 3 times during the process (12 to 15 minutes). The dough should gather around the hook but cling to the bottom and sides of the bowl, tacky but not sticky.

Add hafl the butter and mix again on low speed until fully incorporated (~5 min). Then stop, scrape sides, add the second half and mix until incorporated and mix again until incorporated. After no butter is visible, increase mixer to medium low and mix until dough passes the window test.

Move dough to a surface, fold it a handful of times into a ball, then move back to bowl smooth side up. Cover and let it rise for 30 minutes at room temperature, then in a fridge for 4-24 hours.

##### Loaves
Prepare 2 loaf pans with room temperature butter and parchment paper. Leave an overhang on the sides to pull the loaf up once done.

Move dough to a working surface, deflate it, then separate it into 16 equal parts using a scale. Fold corners in and mold each section into a ball. Place the balls into pans in a 2x4 arrangement and let them rise for 1,5h to 2h, until doubled in size.

Preheat an over to 175ºC.

Cover loaves with an egg wash and bake for ~30 minutes, until risen dramatically and deeply browned. Let cool completely in the pans, then loose short sides with a pairing knife and lift loaves out.

#### Burger buns
Separate dough into 10 pieces, follow the same preparation process and arrange them into 2 baking trays.

## Toum (Lebanese Garlic Sauce)

Schedule: Make "24" hours before serving
Makes: 500ml 
Prep time: 10 min
Cook time: 10 min

Special utensils:
- Food processor
### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup garlic cloves peeled
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/5 cups neutral oil
- Juice of one lemon (about 1/4 cup)


### Instructions
Slice the garlic cloves in half lengthwise and remove any green sprouts.

Transfer the sliced garlic cloves into a food processor and add the salt to the garlic cloves. Process for around a minute until the garlic becomes finely minced almost paste looking. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the food processor.

While the food processor is running, if the food processor has an opening while running, slowly pour one to two tablespoons of oil, then stop and scrape down the bowl. Continue adding another tablespoon or two until the garlic starts looking creamy. If not possible to drizzle slowly, add a couple of table spoons at a time and mix until emulsified.

Once the garlic looks emulsified by the few tablespoons of oil, increase the speed of pouring the oil and alternate with the lemon juice until all the oil and lemon juice is incorporated. This will take about 15 minutes to complete. If too much oil or lemon juice are added the emulsion may break.

Transfer the sauce into a glass container and cover with a paper towel, leave in the fridge overnight. Makes about 500ml. The garlic flavor will mellow over time.

The next day, replace the paper towel with an airtight lid and keep in the fridge for up to 2-3 months. Don't forget to write down the date.




## Japanese Milk Bread

Schedule: Start 5 hours before serving
Makes: 2 loaves (11cm x 30cm x 7cm pan)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ49HpLdZJk&t=498s

Special utensils:
- 2 Loaf Pans

### Ingredients
**Yudane Dough**
- 75g (6 tbsp) bread flour
- 120ml 1⁄2 cup) hot milk

**Dough**
- 60g (3 tbsp) honey
- 420ml lukewarm milk (35ºC-40ºC)
- 7,5g instant yeast
- 720g (5 1⁄4 cups) bread flour
- 45g (6 tbsp) sugar
- 7,5g (1 1⁄2 tbsp) salt
- 90ml whipping cream
- 45g (3 tbsp) softened unsalted butter


### Instructions
Heat the Yudane milk until it starts simmering, then remove from heat and add the reserved flour. Mix until a homogenous dough forms. Reserve, cover with a plastic film or wet kitchen towel and let it cool.

Mix the lukewarm milk, honey and instant yeast until incorporated, reserve.

In a bowl (or the mixing bowl of a stand mixer) add the flour, sugar and salt. Mix them together. Tear the Yudane dough in smaller pieces and add them to the bowl. Add in the liquids (milk/yeast/honey mixture and whipping cream) to the bowl and mix with a sturdy spoon (if using a stand mixer, mix on low until everything is incorporated).

Once all flour is mixed in, knead the dough until the outside gets smooth, then add the butter (cut into small pieces) to the dough and continue kneading until it passes the window test.

Form the dough into a ball, add it back to the bowl and let it rise for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.

Drop the dough into a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 4 pieces. Press each piece to remove any bug air bubbles and form each into a smooth ball. Cover and let it rest for 15 minutes.

Grease both loaf pans with butter.

Using a rolling pin or your hands, flatten each dough portion into a square approximately the size of the loaf pans (around 1cm thick). fold both sides into the dough with a 4cm overlap. Using your fingers, roll the dough towards yourself, pressing the edge with each movement to keep it tight. Once each roll is done, use your fingers to pinch the seam close. Add two rolls into each loaf pan.

Let both loaves proof for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

Preheat a 190ºC oven for 20 minutes. 

Brush the top of each loaf with milk, then bake for 30-35 minutes, rotating both loaves midway through baking.

Remove from the oven, and using oven mittens remove both loaves from the pans and let them cool for at least1. hour before serving.

Keep in an airtight container or bag.
