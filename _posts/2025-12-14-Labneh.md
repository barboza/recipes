Makes: 300g
Prep time: 5 minutes
Total time: 12h-24h

Special utensils:
- Fine mesh sieve or cheese cloth

### Ingredients
- 400ml Greek Yoghurt
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Instructions
Mix the salt into the yoghurt, make sure it's well distributed and no visible grans remain.

Move the yoghurt into the sieve or cheese cloth, let it drain over a container (to catch the whey) in the fridge for 12h-24h. It will get thicker the longer you leave it. Make sure to hang the sieve or cheese cloth in a way it will not touch the liquid.

Remove and store in an airtight container in the fridge.
