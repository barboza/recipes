### Instructions
#### Cake
Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

Grease the cake pan with butter.

In a big bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt

In a blender add the oil, eggs, carrots and sugar and blend until smooth and emulsified, around 3-5 minutes.

Fold the blended mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing well to avoid any flour lumps.

Add the batter to the pan and bake for around 30 minutes, or util golden brown on top and a cake tester stays clean.

#### Glaze
When the cake is almost done, mix all ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, keep mixing to avoid any burning.

Boil the mixture for 5 to 10 minutes, until bubbles get bugger, the mixture gets thick and it crystallises when dropped into a cold plate.

Immediately spread the glaze over the hot cake, let it cool for 20 minutes before serving.
