Makes 15 buns

### Ingredients
- 128 grams (1 cup) raw shelled pistachios
- 105 grams (½ cup) Demerara sugar
- 1tsp finely grated lemon zest
- ¾tsp ground cardamom
- ½tsp kosher salt
- 113 grams (½ cup) unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon, at room temperature, for greasing the pan
- 2tbsp honey/maple
- 1 recipe of [[All-Purpose Enriched Bread]]

### Instructions
Toast the pistachios in a baking sheet, shaking midway, until golden brown and nutty smelling (6-10 minutes). Let cool completely then crush into smaller pieces.

Combine sugar, lemon zest, cardamom and salt in a bowl. Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture for sprinkling onver the baked buns, then combine the rest into the pistachios.

In a saucepan, combine the honey/maple and butter over low heat, stirring ocasionally, until butter is melted and everything is combined. Remove and set aside.

Grease a 16-9 inch baking dish with butter.

Move dough from fridge into a work surface, deflating it and dusting both the surface and dough. Roll it into a  50x30cm (22-12in) rectangle, around 5mm (1/4 inches) tall. Try to work quickly to avoid it sticking too much.

Remove excess flour and brush 3 tbsp of butter mixture into the dough. Sprinkle the pistachio mixture evenly across the surface, pressing into the dough. Roll into a log and chill for 15min until firm. Slice into 15 pieces using a serrated knife and arrange them into the baking dish in a 3x5 grid.

Cover with plastic and let it rise for 1,5 to 2h, until very puffed and double in size.

Preheat an over to 175ºC, then move buns to the oven for 30 minutes, rotating midway, until golden brown all over. Remove and imediatelly brush the remaining butter mixture and sprinkle the rest of the sugar mixture. Let cool completely.
