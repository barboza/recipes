Schedule: 10 minutes prep time, 20 minutes cook time
Makes: 2 portions

### Ingredients
- [ ] 225g dried spaghetti
- [ ] 60ml (1⁄4 cup) extra virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- [ ] 10 garlic cloves, thinly sliced (50g)
- [ ] 1⁄4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- [ ] 1⁄4 cup (10g) finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
- [ ] 3⁄4 cup (180g) creamy ricotta cheese
- [ ] 1⁄2 tsp. salt, plus more for pasta
- [ ] 1⁄4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions
Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions, 9 to 12 minutes. Drain in a colander.

Heat the olive oil in the now-empty pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until the garlic is very fragrant and soft, 2 1⁄2 to 3 1⁄2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and add the cooked spaghetti, 1⁄2 tsp. salt, 1⁄4 tsp. black pepper and the parsley. Toss the pasta to evenly coat it with the infused oil.

Transfer the pasta onto serving plates and top each portion with a generous dollop of ricotta cheese. Drizzle with olive oil and finish with additional black pepper.
