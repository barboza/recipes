Makes 2 loaves
### Ingredients
-  240 grams (1 cup) whole milk or buttermilk
- 50 grams (6tbsp) plus 490 grams (3¾ cups) 550 flour, plus more, if needed, for work surface
- 5 large eggs, chilled
- 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
- 50 grams (¼ cup) granulated sugar
- 10 grams kosher salt
- 6 grams (2 tsp) active dry yeast
- 113 grams (½ cup) unsalted butter, cut into 1cm pieces, chilled, plus more, at room temperature, for pans

### Instructions

#### Tangzhong
In a saucepan, mix the milk and 50g (6 tbsp) flour. Bring over medium heat, whisk continuously, until tickened to a mashed potato consistency.
Add to a mixer bowl and let cool to room temperature (1h).

#### Dough
On the bowl with the room temperature tangzhong add 4 eggs, the oil, sugar, salt, yeast and remaining flour. Mix using the hook attachment on low until combined (~3 minutes). Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix on medium low until smooth, firm and elastic, scraping the sides 2 to 3 times during the process (12 to 15 minutes). The dough should gather around the hook but cling to the bottom and sides of the bowl, tacky but not sticky.

Add hafl the butter and mix again on low speed until fully incorporated (~5 min). Then stop, scrape sides, add the second half and mix until incorporated and mix again until incorporated. After no butter is visible, increase mixer to medium low and mix until dough passes the window test.

Move dough to a surface, fold it a handful of times into a ball, then move back to bowl smooth side up. Cover and let it rise for 30 minutes at room temperature, then in a fridge for 4-24 hours.

##### Loaves
Prepare 2 loaf pans with room temperature butter and parchment paper. Leave an overhang on the sides to pull the loaf up once done.

Move dough to a working surface, deflate it, then separate it into 16 equal parts using a scale. Fold corners in and mold each section into a ball. Place the balls into pans in a 2x4 arrangement and let them rise for 1,5h to 2h, until doubled in size.

Preheat an over to 175ºC.

Cover loaves with an egg wash and bake for ~30 minutes, until risen dramatically and deeply browned. Let cool completely in the pans, then loose short sides with a pairing knife and lift loaves out.

#### Burger buns
Separate dough into 10 pieces, follow the same preparation process and arrange them into 2 baking trays.
