Makes: 6 120ml ramekins
Prep time: 10 minutes
Cook time: 30 minutes

Special utensils:
- Ramekins
- Kitchen torch


### Ingredients
- 320ml milk (1 1⁄3 cup)
- 160ml heavy cream (2⁄3 cup)
- Seeds from half a vanilla bean (pod reserved) or 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 large egg yolks (45g), at room temperature
- 1 large egg (50g), at room temperature
- 50g demerara sugar (1⁄4 cup) + extra for topping

### Instructions
If using an oven, preheat oven to 150ºC.

Add the milk and vanilla beans (or extract) into a saucepan. Over medium heat, whisk occasionally to disperse the vanilla seeds until the mixture is steaming and slowly rippling beneath the surface (around 5 minutes).

In the meanwhile, vigorously the eggs, yolks and sugar until frothy and slightly thicken.

Once the milk is ready, add the milk into the egg mixture, a little bit at a time, always mixing to avoid cooking the eggs.

Pass the mixture through a sieve and divide the mixture equally into the ramekins. Cover with aluminum foil and make a couple of holes for steam into the foils.

**Instant pot**
Add 1 1⁄2 cup water into the instant pot. Add the steaming grate and then carefully lower the ramekins into two layers.
Cook for 13 minutes on low pressure, turn the instant pot off and wait 15 minutes until removing the pressure. The edges should be set but the middle should still be jiggly, if not cook for another 2 minutes on low pressure and wait 15 minutes for the pressure release.

**Oven**
Boil a kettle of water.
Line a deep baking tray with a kitchen tower and carefully add the ramekins to it. Move into the oven and carefully pour boiling water into the baking dish, around 1cm deep. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the edges should be set but the middle should still be jiggly.

Let it cool completely and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, ideally overnight.

Add 2 tbsp demerara sugar to the top of the Crèmes and torch slowly until the sugar is melted and golden brown, one Crème at a time. Serve imediatelly.
