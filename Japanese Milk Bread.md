Special utensils:
- [ ] 2 Loaf Pans

### Ingredients
**Yudane Dough**
- [ ] 75g (6 tbsp) bread flour
- [ ] 120ml 1⁄2 cup) hot milk

**Dough**
- [ ] 60g (3 tbsp) honey
- [ ] 420ml lukewarm milk (35ºC-40ºC)
- [ ] 7,5g instant yeast
- [ ] 720g (5 1⁄4 cups) bread flour
- [ ] 45g (6 tbsp) sugar
- [ ] 7,5g (1 1⁄2 tbsp) salt
- [ ] 90ml whipping cream
- [ ] 45g (3 tbsp) softened unsalted butter


### Instructions
Heat the Yudane milk until it starts simmering, then remove from heat and add the reserved flour. Mix until a homogenous dough forms. Reserve, cover with a plastic film or wet kitchen towel and let it cool.

Mix the lukewarm milk, honey and instant yeast until incorporated, reserve.

In a bowl (or the mixing bowl of a stand mixer) add the flour, sugar and salt. Mix them together. Tear the Yudane dough in smaller pieces and add them to the bowl. Add in the liquids (milk/yeast/honey mixture and whipping cream) to the bowl and mix with a sturdy spoon (if using a stand mixer, mix on low until everything is incorporated).

Once all flour is mixed in, knead the dough until the outside gets smooth, then add the butter (cut into small pieces) to the dough and continue kneading until it passes the window test.

Form the dough into a ball, add it back to the bowl and let it rise for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.

Drop the dough into a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 4 pieces. Press each piece to remove any bug air bubbles and form each into a smooth ball. Cover and let it rest for 15 minutes.

Grease both loaf pans with butter.

Using a rolling pin or your hands, flatten each dough portion into a square approximately the size of the loaf pans (around 1cm thick). fold both sides into the dough with a 4cm overlap. Using your fingers, roll the dough towards yourself, pressing the edge with each movement to keep it tight. Once each roll is done, use your fingers to pinch the seam close. Add two rolls into each loaf pan.

Let both loaves proof for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

Preheat a 190ºC oven for 20 minutes. 

Brush the top of each loaf with milk, then bake for 30-35 minutes, rotating both loaves midway through baking.

Remove from the oven, and using oven mittens remove both loaves from the pans and let them cool for at least1. hour before serving.

Keep in an airtight container or bag.
